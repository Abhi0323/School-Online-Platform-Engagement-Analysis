***Online School Platform Engagement Metrics***

In the age of digital learning, understanding how students and teachers engage with online educational platforms is critical. The "Online School Platform Engagement Metrics" project delves deep into the heart of this interaction by analyzing a comprehensive dataset from a school's online portal. Through meticulous SQL querying, the project extracts nuanced insights into login frequencies, participation rates, and activity patterns.


**The Data**

The dataset provided a granular view of daily student and teacher interactions with the school's portal. It included variables such as login timestamps, activity logs, and user demographics. From this rich dataset, the project aimed to track login percentages, identify consistent engagement patterns, and estimate potential revenue from billable student activities.

**SQL Queries**

A series of sophisticated SQL queries were crafted to:

Calculate the overall and daily login percentages for teachers and students.
Determine consecutive login streaks to gauge consistent engagement.
Estimate revenue based on active student participation.
Compare activity across grades and schools to identify trends and outliers.
Each query was meticulously designed to handle the complexities of the data, ensuring accurate and insightful results.

**Power BI Dashboard**

To translate these insights into actionable intelligence, a Power BI dashboard was developed. It features:

Interactive filters for selecting specific schools and time frames.
Visual trends of daily login percentages, offering a quick understanding of engagement over time.
Breakdowns of login activities by grade, providing clarity on student engagement across different levels.
Benchmarking of overall teacher login percentages, highlighting areas for potential improvement in teacher engagement.
Comparative analysis of teacher login activity across multiple schools, offering a broader perspective on engagement standards.
Impact and Use Cases

**This project has a wide array of applications:**

School Administrators can identify engagement patterns and tailor strategies to increase platform utilization.
Teachers can receive feedback on their engagement with the platform, informing personal and professional development.
Students benefit indirectly as the analysis can lead to an improved and more engaging learning environment.
EdTech Developers can use these insights to refine and evolve the features of educational platforms for better user experiences.

**Conclusion**

"Online School Platform Engagement Metrics Project" stands as a testament to the power of data-driven decision-making in education. It exemplifies how technical expertise in data querying and visualization can lead to profound insights and, ultimately, an enhanced educational experience in the digital realm.

-- Tried different logics for the 1st question, because of not receiving any schools with more than 60% overall login%.

--1.b Now I am assuming if the teachers last date is true then they might be on a leave for the remaining days. 
---So, I am not considering the entries showing false for a teacher after their last login date is true.
